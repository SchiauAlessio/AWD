                    stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and more. It has fascinated humanity for centuries and is a field
                    of continuous exploration and discovery.</p>

                <p>Personal space is the physical and emotional space around an individual that they consider their own.
                    It's essential for personal comfort and mental well-being. Violating someone's personal space can
                    lead to discomfort or anxiety.</p>

                <h2>Architectural Space</h2>
                <p>Architectural space refers to the three-dimensional area created by the design of buildings and
                    structures.
                    It involves the arrangement and organization of rooms, corridors, hallways, ceilings, floors, and
                    walls within a built environment.
                    <br>
                    The four fundamental types of spaces in architecture are the Physical Space, Perceptual Space,
                    Directional Space, and Interwoven Space.

                <h2>Space-Time</h2>
                <p>Space-time is a concept in physics, combining the three dimensions of space with the fourth
                    dimension,
                    time. In this model, events occur within a four-dimensional continuum, where space and time are
                    intertwined, particularly in the theory of relativity.</p>

                <h2>Space-bar</h2>
                <p>The spacebar is the longest key on a computer keyboard, typically used to insert a space between
                    words or characters when typing. It plays a crucial role in separating text to ensure clarity and
                    readability in written communication. The spacebar is a fundamental tool for typing and contributes
                    to the flow and organization of text, enabling efficient and accurate word processing.</p>
